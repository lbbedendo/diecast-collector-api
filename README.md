# Diecast Collector API

**diecast-collector-api** Is a REST API developed with **Micronaut Framework**. It's goal is to help me keep track of my miniature car collection (Hot Wheels, Maisto, California Collectibles, etc) and to provide a general use case for studying new technologies.
Also check out the [Web App](https://github.com/lbbedendo/diecast-collector-app) built with React.
